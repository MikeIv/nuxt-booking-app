When working with this project, always rely on Nuxt 4 standards and best practices, and monitor the use of auto-import, composables, and server-side features. Write code in TypeScript, unless otherwise specified. Integrate all new pages, modules, and plug-ins in accordance with the Nuxt 4 documentation. Before making changes, specify the details of the project structure and ask if there is not enough information.

Always take into account the features of the Nuxt 4 architecture — server rendering, auto-import of components and modules, composables, Nuxt plugins.

Write code compatible with Vue 3, TypeScript (if used), taking into account Nuxt best practices.

For any suggestions on refactoring or adding functionality, use the approaches recommended for Nuxt 4 (for example, defineNuxtConfig, useState, useFetch, definePageMeta, etc.).

First, clarify if there is not enough information about the structure of the current project — ask about schemas/files, directory structures and the availability of custom modules.
